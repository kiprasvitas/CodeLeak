# CodeLeak
A platform to share your code, collaborate in forums, discover people, and build a portfolio.

____________________________________________________________________________________

This is a project built with Javascript, Bootstrap, Mobirise, and Firebase for auth/storage/database. This project took around a month to build and was key step to my understanding of what it takes to build a full-scale platform.

The project can be downloaded and ran locally on your machine or uploaded to a cloud host with an attached Firebase project.
